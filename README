This repository contains all codes(python,bash,f77) for wave gradiometry


work flow:
codes for processing raw data downloaded from IRIS
1)copy seedfile into event folder
2)run 'remove_bad_stations.sh' #remove bad stations
3)create bad file which contains bad stations
4)run 'remove_reponse_origtime.sh' 
#remove instrumental response and modify original time (find nzyear nzjday .. from TA.Q*z file)
#geometry.dat is already created, produce edge_loction.txt if necessary
5)run 'filter_waveforms.sh' 
#filter the waveforms to 20 desired frequency bands
#make sure only one Rayleigh phase is present, aftershocks may give other peaks
6) inside each period folder, run 'get_final.sh' 

post_process:
1) inside the 'events_done' folder, './get_slowness.sh' for all period bands
2) 'vel_stack.py' get average velocity
3) Adjust cpt and -R option in 'plot_stack_velo.sh' to plot velocity figures

calculate variance of px and py:
1)(in waveforms_*)since sigma square is the same for every time step, we only need to calculate it once for each master station
2)(in stationname) calculate variance for Bx By using svd_px_variance and svd_py_variance, then variance for Px and Py
3) we are not calculating variance for A coefficient or strain, since they come from amplitude difference, which can be really small. There is no point of doing so.

estimate density along the raypth
inside the event folder
1)find the lon and lat for the source,'source.loc' 
2)determine an even distribution edge stations using station.ps, 'edge_location.txt'
3)run find_midpoint.py to get a denser distribution, 'polygon.txt'
4) for i in 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120 130 140 150; do cp polygon.txt source_loc Period_$i/final_para; cd Period_$i/final_para; density_main.sh; cat rhs_int_profile_[0-9]* > rhs_int_profile_all; image_rhs_profile; image_rhs_station; image_int; mv rhs*ps int*ps ../../plots; cd ../..; done
4-1)copy source.loc and polygon.txt to each period/final_para folder
4-2)run density_main.sh to produce rhs and int at each point along the ray path, 'rhs_int_profile_*'
4-3)cat rhs_int_profile_* > rhs_int_profile_all, image_rhs, image_int
