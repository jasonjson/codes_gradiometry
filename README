This repository contains all codes(python,bash,f77) for wave gradiometry


pre_process:
codes for processing raw data downloaded from IRIS
1)copy seedfile into event folder
2)run 'remove_bad_stations.sh' #remove bad stations
3)create bad file which contains bad stations
4)run 'remove_reponse_origtime.sh' 
#remove instrumental response and modify original time (find nzyear nzjday .. from TA.Q*z file)
5)
#filter the waveforms to the desired frequency bands

process:
calculate four parameters

post_process:
stack,plots,etc.
More needs to be done
