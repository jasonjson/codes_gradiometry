This repository contains all codes(python,bash,f77) for wave gradiometry


work flow:
codes for processing raw data downloaded from IRIS
1)copy seedfile into event folder
2)run 'remove_bad_stations.sh' #remove bad stations
3)create 'bad' which contains bad stations far away from main array, create 'edge' file for plotting
4)run 'remove_reponse_origtime.sh' 
5)run 'filter_waveforms.sh' 
#filter the waveforms to 20 desired frequency bands, and qsub the job
#make sure only one Rayleigh phase is present, aftershocks may give other peaks

post_process:
stack
