This repository contains all codes(python,bash,f77) for wave gradiometry


work flow:
codes for processing raw data downloaded from IRIS
1)copy seedfile into event folder
2)run 'remove_bad_stations.sh' #remove bad stations
3)create bad file which contains bad stations
4)run 'remove_reponse_origtime.sh' 
#remove instrumental response and modify original time (find nzyear nzjday .. from TA.Q*z file)
#geometry.dat is already created, produce edge_loction.txt if necessary
5)run 'filter_waveforms.sh' 
#filter the waveforms to 20 desired frequency bands
#make sure only one Rayleigh phase is present, aftershocks may give other peaks
6) inside each period folder, run 'get_final.sh' 

post_process:
averaging final dyanmic and structural phase velocities:
1)stack dyna and stru velocities in the server, modify and run 'get_slowness.sh'
2)averge, modify and run 'vel_stack.py'
3)plot final figures, modify and run 'plot_final.sh', modifty -R and edge_location.txt
