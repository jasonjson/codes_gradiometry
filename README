This repository contains all codes(python,bash,f77) for wave gradiometry


work flow:
codes for processing raw data downloaded from IRIS
1)copy seedfile into event folder
2)run 'remove_bad_stations.sh' #remove bad stations
3)create bad file which contains bad stations
4)run 'remove_reponse_origtime.sh' 
#remove instrumental response and modify original time (find nzyear nzjday .. from TA.Q*z file)
#geometry.dat is already created, produce edge_loction.txt if necessary
5)run 'filter_waveforms.sh' 
#filter the waveforms to 20 desired frequency bands
#make sure only one Rayleigh phase is present, aftershocks may give other peaks
6) inside each period folder, run 'get_final.sh' 

post_process:
1) inside the 'events_done' folder, './get_slowness.sh' for all period bands
2) 'vel_stack.py' get average velocity
3) 'plot_stack_velo.sh' plot velocity figures

calculate variance of px and py:
1)(in waveforms_*)since sigma square is the same for every time step, we only need to calculate it once for each master station
2)(in stationname) calculate variance for Bx By using svd_px_variance and svd_py_variance, then variance for Px and Py
3) we are not calculating variance for A coefficient or strain, since they come from amplitude difference, which can be really small. There is no point of doing so.
